Hi, I'm Louis Van de Calseyde, a mostly self taught web developer from Ghent, Belgium.
I'm currently working for [Showpad](http://www.showpad.com) as a frontend developer on various applications that the platform Showpad is.

Previously I worked for [Yaska](http://yaska.eu) on projects like Nespresso and eHealth Nordic.
While I was at school I co-founded a creative agency, [Integral Studios](http://integralstudios.be/) with 2 friends.
