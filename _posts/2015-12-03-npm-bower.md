title: How and why we replaced bower with npm

At [Showpad](http://www.showpad.com/) we have been using [bower](http://bower.io/) for years now. In the beginning we were super excited to have a package manager for frontend libraries.

Then the build tool explosion came along and we used [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage all the plugins we were using to generate production ready code.

Which in turn got us thinking… Wouldn’t it be nice to have one package manager to rule all modules?
The decision was quite easy and we went with npm. Especially now that [npm3](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/122450408965/npm-weekly-20-npm-3-is-here-ish) is out in the wild (yay flat tree!).

So, how would we manage the transition? Because, let’s be honest, bower is quite easy to use. After some tinkering I came up with the following solution:

{% gist e5828f0e2f866e886e8f %}

{% gist 3c51dd46b6cfe4853ba1 %}

{% gist 5b2ff01cfe466f4f3ced %}

And there you have it. Clean and simple.
As you probably noticed we are using [rollup](http://rollupjs.org/). Rollup is a fairly new module bundler with a lot of potential. We chose rollup over [browserify](http://browserify.org/) for a couple of reasons:
1. the modules we use are just plain javascript; so no [CommonJS](http://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html)
2. it feels nice to use the Ecmascript standard
3. smaller bundle in the end

As for now we don’t use any CommonJS powered modules. But if that is your thing, you can easily extend the gulp task to use a [rollup plugin](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs) that handles CommonJS. Or use our good ol’ friend, browserify.
